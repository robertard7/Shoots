-AI / AUTOMATION USAGE
+AI & AUTOMATION NOTES
 ---------------------
 Documentation only. No enforcement implied.
-
-This repository includes guidance in Agent.md for contributors who use AI tools.
-
-Suggested expectations for contributions:
-
-- Keep changes within the repository root
-- Provide clean, reviewable diffs
-- Avoid claiming execution results without evidence
-- Treat CI results as authoritative only when they run
+Shoots may be explored, modified, or reviewed using automated tools.
+This repository does not define, restrict, or validate the behavior of such tools.
+All automation behavior is external and user-controlled.

 BUILD & VALIDATION
